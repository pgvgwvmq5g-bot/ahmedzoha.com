## Biography

I believe AI should do more than think—it should care. As a technology leader, educator, and advocate for responsible innovation, I have dedicated my career to building intelligent systems that advance **AI for social good**.

Recognized among **Stanford's Top 2% Most Cited Scientists** and endorsed as a **UK Exceptional Talent** by the Royal Academy of Engineering, I lead research at the intersection of Federated Learning, Edge Intelligence, and AI-Driven Systems. With **4,500+ citations**, **£1M+ in research funding**, and **2 authored books**, my work bridges theoretical breakthroughs with transformative applications—from **award-winning NHS-deployed systems for dementia care** to privacy-preserving technologies for smart cities.

As Director of **FLAIR (Federated Learning and Agentic Intelligence Research)**, I lead a group of dynamic researchers in developing distributed AI that protects privacy while unlocking collaborative intelligence. My vision is a world-leading programme that translates cutting-edge research into real-world impact across healthcare, infrastructure, and beyond.

I am equally passionate about education and mentorship—shaping the next generation of AI researchers and practitioners who will carry this mission forward. For me, the true measure of research is not publications alone, but lives improved and problems solved.
